Importing fonts from google
------------------------------
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Anton&display=swap');

Units
------------------------------
    px, %

Combinators
------------------------------
    1. Adjacent Sibling
        h2 + p {color: red;}

    2. General Sibling
        h2 ~ p{color: red;}

    3. Child
       div > p{color: red;}

    4. Descendant
        div p{color: red;}

box-sizing
------------------------------
content-box [default]: 
    - Width/height apply only to the content.
    - Padding and border are added outside the content box, increasing the total size of the element.
    - Margin is always outside the box and unaffected by box-sizing.

border-box: width and height includes the padding and margin
    - Width/height include content, padding, and border.
    - Padding and border are absorbed into the declared width/height.
    - Margin still sits outside and is unaffected
    - set it through universal select which is *{} since inheritance will not work if provided with body for the block level elements like section

display
------------------------------
    Basic Display Types
        - block : Element takes up full width, starts on a new line (e.g., <div>, <p>)
        - inline : Element flows within text, no width/height control (e.g., <span>)
        - inline-block : Like inline, but allows width and height
        - none : Element is removed from layout (invisible and non-interactive)
        - contents : Makes the container disappear, leaving only its children

    Layout Containers
        - flex : Creates a flex container for flexible layouts
        - inline-flex : Same as flex, but behaves like an inline element 
        - grid : Creates a grid container for two-dimensional layouts
        - inline-grid : Same as grid, but inline 
        - flow-root : Establishes a new block formatting context

    Table-Like Layouts
        - table : Behaves like a <table> 
        - table-row, table-cell etc: Mimics specific table parts like rows and cells 

    Other Values
        - list-item : Behaves like a <li> with bullet styling 
        - run-in : Rarely used; behaves as block or inline based on context 
        - initial : Resets to default (inline) 
        - inherit : Inherits from parent element
        - unset : Removes any set value, reverting to inherited or initial 

    Block level elements 
        <div> , <section> , <article> , <nav>  but also <h1> , <h2>  etc and <p>

    Inline elements
        <a> , <span> , <img> etc
        margin-top  and margin-bottom  have no effect on the element
        width  or height  on an inline element also has no effect

    Inline-Block
        Behaves like and inline element
        Respects width, height, margin and padding like a block element
        Great for button, forms inputs or layouts

Pseudo Classes and elements
------------------------------
    classes: :class name --- specific state of the element [hover, focus, active, first-Child, nth-child, checked, not(selector)]
    element: :: element name --- specific part of an element [before, after, first-letter, first-line, placeholder, selection]

    we can combine pseudo classes and elements as well 

    a:hover::after {
        content: " ðŸ”—";
    }

box-shadow
------------------------------
    box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);

    box-shadow: offset-x offset-y blur-radius spread-radius color;
        - 2px â†’ Horizontal offset (moves the shadow 2px to the right)
        - 2px â†’ Vertical offset (moves the shadow 2px down)
        - 2px â†’ Blur radius (softens the edges of the shadow)
        - 2px â†’ Spread radius (expands the size of the shadow outward)
        -rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) â†’ Color (semi-transparent black)

Position
------------------------------
    static: default value, this is automatically applied
    fixed: take the element out of document flow and behaves like inline-block, viewport is the parent
    z-index: default ia auto or 0
    absolute: if parent has no position applied then parent is html
    relative: element is not taken out of document flow
    sticky:
    positioning context: top, right, bpttom, left
    stacking context:
